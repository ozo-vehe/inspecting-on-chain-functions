```solidity
/**
 * @dev Delegates execution to an implementation contract.
 * It returns to the external caller whatever the implementation returns
 * or forwards reverts.
 */
function () payable external {
    // delegate all other functions to current implementation
    (bool success, ) = comptrollerImplementation.delegatecall(msg.data);

    // solium-disable-next-line security/no-inline-assembly
    assembly {
          let free_mem_ptr := mload(0x40)
          returndatacopy(free_mem_ptr, 0, returndatasize)

          switch success
          case 0 { revert(free_mem_ptr, returndatasize) }
          default { return(free_mem_ptr, returndatasize) }
    }
}
```

4. **Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:** `delegatecall`

## Explanation

### Purpose
The fallback function in the Comptroller contract delegates execution to another contract, referred to as `comptrollerImplementation`. This allows the Comptroller contract to forward any function calls it receives to the implementation contract. The purpose of this pattern is to enable upgradability of the contract. By delegating calls to another contract, the logic of the Comptroller can be updated without changing the address of the deployed contract.

### Detailed Usage
The function utilizes the `delegatecall` method to forward any incoming call to the `comptrollerImplementation` contract. The `delegatecall` preserves the context (storage, caller, etc.) of the Comptroller contract while executing the code of the `comptrollerImplementation` contract. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Delegate Call**: 
   ```solidity
   (bool success, ) = comptrollerImplementation.delegatecall(msg.data);
   ```
   This line forwards the incoming call's data (`msg.data`) to the `comptrollerImplementation` contract. The `delegatecall` returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

2. **Assembly Code for Handling Return Data**:
   ```solidity
   assembly {
         let free_mem_ptr := mload(0x40)
         returndatacopy(free_mem_ptr, 0, returndatasize)

         switch success
         case 0 { revert(free_mem_ptr, returndatasize) }
         default { return(free_mem_ptr, returndatasize) }
   }
   ```
   - `mload(0x40)`: Loads the free memory pointer.
   - `returndatacopy(free_mem_ptr, 0, returndatasize)`: Copies the returned data from the delegate call to memory.
   - `switch success`: Checks the result of the delegate call.
     - If the call failed (`case 0`), it reverts with the returned data.
     - If the call succeeded, it returns the data to the caller.

### Impact
The use of `delegatecall` in this fallback function is crucial for the upgradability of the Compound protocol's Comptroller contract. By delegating calls to the `comptrollerImplementation`, the protocol can update the logic of the Comptroller without needing to redeploy and migrate to a new contract address. This ensures that the protocol remains flexible and can adapt to changes or improvements in the contract logic while maintaining the same interface and contract address for users and other interacting contracts.
